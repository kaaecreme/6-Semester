    "Data validity checking is an essential part of robust code, and in Python the 'fail-fast' method is used extensively: instead of lingering on trying to get the 'best' out of an erroneous situation, the fail-fast pragma will be very loud about any data inconsistencies at the earliest possible moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence robust code should include a lot of error checking, say as pre- and post-conditions (part of the design-by-contract programming) when calling a function: when entering the function you check that all parameters are ok (pre-condition), and when leaving you check the return parameter (post-conditions).  \n",
