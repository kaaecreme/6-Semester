    "## L07 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Introduction to CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional nerual network (CNN) is a specific type of neural network (NN), \n",
    "designed for processing data like images. Whereas NN can be \"general-purpose\",\n",
    "the CNN is more focused on analzying grid-like data, which is what images are.\n",
    "Therefore the CNN would be prefered to use in cases like image classification,\n",
    "where you would label items in the image, and object detection in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolutional layer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A CNN consists of multiple layers where the convolutional layer is the building block of the CNN,\n",
    "and this layer is also where the neural network has its name from. \n",
    "This layer aplies different filters to the input data. Each of these filters can be described as a small matrix filled with weights,\n",
    "that moves across the data (like moving across a image) doing calculations at each of its positions, this operation is called convolution.\n",
    "The goal of these filters is to find features or patterns within the image. \n",
    "Examples of this can be edges of motives in the image, and later more complex things in the image, like shapes and recognizable parts of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pooling layer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling layers goal is to reduce the input data into small parts, therefor with images a small part will be a small group of pixels.\n",
    "The two most common technic of doing this is Max pooling or average pooling.\n",
    "The max pooling takes maximum values of the small part of the input data, \n",
    "where the average pooling takes the average value from the small part of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fully Connected layer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly there is the fully connected layer, which combines the several layers of convolutional and pooling layers. \n",
    "Here the classification task is performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) How CNNs learn [_SOURCE: GEMINI_]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional and pooling layers work together to extract a hierarchy of features from the input image,\n",
    "going from simple to complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers analyze these high-level features,\n",
    "ultimately predicting the class of the input image or the locations of objects within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backpropagation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other neural networks, CNNs learn through a process called backpropagation. \n",
    "This involves calculating the error between the predicted output and the correct label, \n",
    "and then adjusting the weights within the filters and all layers backwards through the network to minimize that error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code is structured as a class, where there are 3 different methods. `createModel()` is the method responsible for creating a CNN model with the Keras API, `train_and_test_model()` method will train and test the model with the mnit-dataset. We've decided to use the built-in feature, where the dataset is already split up and the test-data is only being tested on. `plotTrainingData` plots the mean of loss and accuracy of each epoch, this way we can see, how the amount of epochs affect the accuracy and loss of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've primarily been testing with the amount of epochs and how it affect the accuracy and loss of our model. The number of layers and amount of neurons hasn't been manipulated, because we want to keep these factors stabile.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've seen is that when the amount of epochs exceed 5-10 the model will still get better, both loss and accuracy, but the amount is descending and it doesn't get better at a rate, where it'll be worth it to keep expanding the amount of epochs. "
