    "### Qe) Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now worked with different performance metrics that shows how \"good\" your machine learning model is. In the first exercise we implemented the accuracy function and tested it with our dummy classifier and our SGD classifier. From this it was shown that the accuracy can give a great score (around 90%) to a machine learning model (our dummy classifier) which was totaly wrong, therfore we should be carefull to conclude how great our model is by only using the accuracy as our score. Afterwards we implemented the precision, recall and F1-score as further ways of judging our models. Now our dummy classifier will be found out to be a bad model, as it scores zero in these tests, wheras our SGD classifier still deliveres good scores. Therefore it can be concluded that it is important to take multiple scores into account, when judging a machine learning model. Lastly we created and showed a confussion matrix with the dummy classifier and SGD classifier, which creates an overview of how your model is performing, by showing the TN, FP, FN and TP. By using this overview it is quickly seen that the dummy classifier is performing worse than the sgd classifier since it is not predicting any TP, but instead predicting alot of FN."
